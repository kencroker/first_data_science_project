# first_data_science_project

Today, I created a simple linear regression to plot the relationship between the weight and horsepower of a car using SciKit Learn and Pandas. 
I'm just starting my data science journey, and I'm excited to learn all about it!
I decided to begin sharing my projects, even the most simple ones, to Github in order to encourage myself to code more frequently and grow my skills.
Please let me know if you have any suggestions!
